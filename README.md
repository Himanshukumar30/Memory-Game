# Memory-Game


I developed this project to demonstrate my skills for DOM manipulation using JavaScript. 

## Description

Memory game asks user to interact with the boxes where they have click on each box and identify identical cards. Game allows to unhide two cards at a time. If two card matches, they stay open on the page and user continues to identify the same cards. The game counts the number of clicks it took to identify all the cards. The player with less number of clicks wins!

# Development
- Start by creating index HTML and its styling.
- Create JavaScript which modifies the DOM element to pick an element from array. This is done by using even listener for click even on the button.
- Javascript involves incrementing the counter and picking corresponding element from array which cotains information like author, job title and bio. This is then displayed using an event listener for click event on the button.
